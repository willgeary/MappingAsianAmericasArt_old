# Mapping Asian / Americas Art
This is the repository for the ***Mapping Asian / Americas Art*** course at Columbia University. The notes and tutorials in this course will borrow heavily from Juan Francisco Saldarriaga's Fall 2016 [***Mapping for Architecture, Urbanism and the Humanities***](https://github.com/juanfrans-courses/mapping_arch_hum) course.
